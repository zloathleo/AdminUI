propsync：vue组件的混合对象，主要用于组件编写时混入调用。\r\n *\r\n * 【主要功能】\r\n * 1、实现了在组件内自动创建所有prop对应的data属性，方便组件内修改prop使用。解决了vue2.0中不允许组件内直接修改prop的设计。\r\n * 2、实现了组件外修改组件prop，组件内自动同步修改到data属性。\r\n * 3、实现了组件内修改了data属性（由prop创建的），自动向组件外发出事件通知有内部prop修改。由组件外决定是否要将修改同步到组件外\r\n *\r\n * 【使用方法】\r\n * 1、编写组件：在选项对象中增加 mixins:[propsync]即可，无需其他修改\r\n * 2、调用组件：在调用组件的templat处，增加一个事件监听 onPropsChange（可修改）,当组件内修改了props时会调用此函数，返回 修改prop名称，修改后值，修改前值\r\n *\r\n * 调用组件例：\r\n * <mycomponent :prop1=\"xxx\" :prop2=\"xxx\" @onPropsChange=\"change\"></mycomponent>\r\n *\r\n * {\r\n *   methods:{\r\n *     change:function(propName,newVal,oldVal){\r\n *       this[propName]=newVal;\r\n *       console.log(\"组件mycomponent的\" +propName+ \"属性由\" +oldVal+ \"修改为了\" +newVal);\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * 【可配置忽略】\r\n * 默认情况下，调用了本mixin的组件，会实现组件定义的所有的props，创建对应data变量，绑定双向watch。\r\n * 若希望某个props不进行绑定（如仅纯展示型props），则可在那个props中增加propsync:false(可配置)来忽略，默认所有props均为true\r\n * 例：\r\n * props:{\r\n *   xxx:{\r\n *     type: String,\r\n *     default: \"xxx\",\r\n *     propsync: false//增加此props的属性，则本mixin会忽略xxx\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n */\r\n/**\r\n * 【配置】\r\n * 当在组件内部修改了prop属性，对外emit发出的事件名称\r\n */\r\nconst emitPropsChangeName = \"onPropsChange\";\r\n/**\r\n * 【配置】\r\n * 可在组件属性中定义当前props是否参加本mixin实现双向绑定。\r\n */\r\nconst isEnableName = \"propsync\";\r\n/**\r\n * 【配置】\r\n * 根据prop的名称生成对应的data属性名，可自行修改生成后的名称。\r\n * 默认为在prop属性名前面增加\"p_\"，即若prop中有字段名为\"active\"，则自动生成名为\"p_active\"的data字段\r\n *\r\n * @param {string} propName 组件prop字段名称\r\n * @returns {string}
